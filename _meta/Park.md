## Why?

Because this park is sick, there's crazy mountains and all sorts of crazy shit to check out. If you've ever seen gone with the wind its kind of like that but on acid

**Note:** Don't come to this park if you can't do the trillest of hikes, and don't come in April.

### Kayak Twisted Canyon

You can rent a kayak for super cheap at [this vendors site](http://vendor.com) and spend a day kayaking down the river. Usually takes a whole day, bring a bluetooth speaker and have fun!

**Note:** This shit costs like 200 bucks but it's totally worth it.

## Hot Tips

### Rental Car

The Hertz at the Havasupai airport has a manager named Ron and he will hook you up if you say you know Donny Falcone.

### Food

Don't eat the quesadilla at the tortilla factory down the street if you dont want to die

### Water

Just drink a bunch of water before you leave for the day then you don't have to bring a bunch with you on the hikes.
