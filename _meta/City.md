## Why?

Honestly, this is the greatest city on earth. If you like food or architecture this is the shit, and if you like partying you'll also have fun.

**Note:** Don't come to this park if you can't do the trillest of hikes, and don't come in April.

## Adventures

### Explore Diagon Alley

Yo this part of town is dope! Crazy architecture, winding streets, and all sorts of shit. Stop off at Panama Coffee and try the Geisha coffee!

### Party at Club 420

The parties here are insane and last for up to 4 days. Grab a costume and get ready for a fun weekend!

**Note:** Best time to show up is like 10PM on a Friday or Saturday or the line is too long. Give the bounce 20 bucks and tell him you know Paco.

## Hot Tips

### Pizza

People will always tell you the best pizza is in PicoVille but they're full of shit, go to Mikey's on 10th and get the Diavola.

### Newark Airport

Don't fly into Newark it's a fucking pain in the ass and costs like 100 bucks to take a cab into the city, pay the extra whatever like ten dollars to fly into JFK or LGA so you don't have to fuck around in New Jersey.
