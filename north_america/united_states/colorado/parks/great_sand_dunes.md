[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve](https://www.nps.gov/grsa/index.htm) is a United States National Park located in South-Central Colorado.

## Why?

Because this park contains the tallest dunes in North America, with Star Dune rising over 750 feet from top to bottom.

## Adventures

### Scenic Backcountry Route

Have a high-clearance 4WD vehicle? Take Medano Pass (9,931ft elevation), a scenic off-road trail that passes through the dunes. The 22 mile road includes soft sand for about 4 miles, 9 creek crossings, and a rocky roadbed near the summit of the pass.

**Note:** Dropping tire air pressure to 15 pounds may be necessary when sand becomes soft.
