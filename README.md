Making lists of cool shit to do all over the world.

TripAdvisor, Yelp, etc. are cool if you like doing lame touristy shit and not having any fun.

If your idea of a good time is driving speed boats in manhattan, exploring hidden beaches in oahu, buying drugs in the mexican riviera, shooting machine guns in distant deserts, or illegally climbing mountains then you might find this website useful.

(Probably nothing here yet!)
